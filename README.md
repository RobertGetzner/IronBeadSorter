My Iron Beads color sorting machine utilizes an USB camera connected to a PC, OpenCV for image processing, and an Arduino UNO to control two stepper motors. The machine operates by analyzing images from the USB camera for circular shapes, masking the found circles, and comparing the remaining histogram to histograms of training images. 

# Installation
You will require hardware similar to what I used (Isolator, turntable). Upload Arduino code and run the python code, where your python runtime will require the modules I used in my coding. 

# Contributing
Feel free, but I don't know if I will continue to work on this project as sorting is sufficiently good for me. 

# Licence
